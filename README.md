# Particle Swarm Optimization

## Description
This project was meant to grasp a deeper understanding of Particle Swarm Optimization, a Stochastic Population-based Algorithm.

## Notes
I tried to follow a pythonic way of incorperating it without having to break python-zen.

## Future tasks and planned implementations
* Add a way to plot the objective function *if it is 2D and 3D*
* Optimize code
* Add a hill-climbing aspect to the code
